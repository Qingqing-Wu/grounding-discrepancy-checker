# Grounding Discrepancy Checker

A Python-based desktop application for detecting grounding discrepancies across
multiple warehouse operational data sources.

The tool automates a manual, Excel-heavy reconciliation process by applying
rule-based matching logic and generating discrepancy reports and summaries.

---

## 30-Second Overview

Grounding discrepancies occur when physical inventory grounding records do not
match supporting operational data such as inbound receipts, value-added records,
cancel orders, or transfer orders.

This project provides a **Tkinter-based desktop application** that allows users to
load multiple Excel files, automatically detect mismatches at the UPC level, and
generate discrepancy summaries with optional historical tracking.

The application is designed for daily operational use and does **not require
command-line interaction**.

> **Note:** No raw operational data are included in this repository.  
> The project focuses on discrepancy logic, preprocessing rules, and application design.

## Business Context

Warehouse operations typically generate multiple Excel exports from different
systems, including:

- Grounding records
- Inbound receiving records
- Value-added / customization records
- Cancel order records
- Transfer order records

Because these files are produced independently, mismatches in quantity, timing,
or UPC mapping are common. Manual reconciliation across files is time-consuming
and error-prone, especially at scale.

## Project Objectives

- Automate grounding discrepancy detection across multiple Excel sources
- Identify missing or mismatched records at the UPC level
- Reduce manual Excel reconciliation effort
- Provide repeatable, rule-based discrepancy checks
- Support optional historical discrepancy tracking

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-source Excel ingestion**  
  Reads grounding, inbound, value-added, cancel, and transfer Excel files.

- **UPC-level discrepancy logic**  
  Detects missing records and quantity mismatches.

- **Optional historical tracking**  
  Supports cumulative discrepancy tracking via `historical.xlsx`.

- **Desktop GUI (Tkinter)**  
  Simple file selection and execution without CLI usage.

- **Rule-based, explainable logic**  
  All discrepancy checks are implemented explicitly in Python code.

---

## Supported Input Files

The application supports the following Excel inputs (all optional, depending on use case):

- `Grounding.xlsx`
- `InboundRecordFile.xlsx`
- `ExportCustomRecordsFile.xlsx`
- `Cancel Order.xlsx`
- `Transfer Order.xlsx`
- `historical.xlsx` (optional, for cumulative tracking)

Expected column formats are defined in the preprocessing scripts.

### Application Layer

- Auto_Grounding_Discrepancy_Checker_app_2_0.py
  
Main Tkinter-based desktop application responsible for file selection,
execution flow, and result generation.

### Preprocessing Layer

- grounding preprocessing.py
- cancel order preprocessing.py

These scripts clean, normalize, and standardize Excel inputs from different
operational sources before discrepancy comparison.

### Discrepancy Logic

Rule-based matching logic is applied across grounding, inbound, value-added,
cancel, and transfer sources to identify:

- missing records
- quantity mismatches
- unmatched UPC-level events

All discrepancy checks are deterministic and explicitly implemented in code.

## Example Outputs

Typical outputs generated by the application include:

- missing inbound or value-added records by UPC
- quantity mismatches between grounding and operational sources
- daily discrepancy summaries
- optional historical accumulation of discrepancies

Output files and charts depend on the selected input sources.

## Assumptions & Notes

- Input Excel files must follow the expected column structure defined in the
preprocessing scripts.
- All discrepancy logic is deterministic and rule-based.
- The tool is designed for operational validation, not forecasting or prediction.

## Future Improvements

- Package the application as a standalone executable (e.g., PyInstaller)
- Add unit tests for preprocessing and discrepancy logic
- Improve UI layout and filtering options
- Support additional export formats beyond Excel
